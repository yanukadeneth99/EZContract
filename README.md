# EZContract

Create contracts with an interface, never having to worry about typing code.

## What is EZContract?

EZContract is an easy way to deploy contracts on the blockchain. Instead of writing Solidity Code with Hardhat to deploy, simply fill in the information about your project and just deploy!

Contracts deployed using EZContract are not stored anywhere nor controlled by us. Everything you create, you own completely. To be honest, we don't even know what you did after you deployed.

## How does EZContract work

Select which contract to deploy:
